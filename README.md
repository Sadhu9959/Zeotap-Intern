# CDP Support Chatbot

This is a simple web-based chatbot designed to answer "how-to" questions related to Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) such as Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot provides predefined responses to common questions about these platforms.

## Features

- **Chat Interface:** A user-friendly chat interface where users can type questions.
- **Predefined Responses:** The chatbot has predefined answers for common "how-to" questions about Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap.
- **Dynamic Responses:** The chatbot identifies the CDP platform and the specific task being asked about.
- **Fallback Responses:** If the chatbot does not recognize the question, it provides a fallback response.

## How to Run

1. **Download the Code:**
   - Save the `index.html` file to your computer.

2. **Open the File:**
   - Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.
   - Alternatively, you can right-click the file and select "Open with" to choose a specific browser.

3. **Interact with the Chatbot:**
   - Type questions in the input box and press **Enter** or click **Send**.
   - Example questions:
     - "How do I set up a new source in Segment?"
     - "How can I create a user profile in mParticle?"
     - "How do I build an audience segment in Lytics?"
     - "How can I integrate my data with Zeotap?"

## Example Questions

Here are some example questions you can ask the chatbot:

- **Segment:**
  - "How do I set up a new source in Segment?"
  - "How can I create a user profile in Segment?"

- **mParticle:**
  - "How can I create a user profile in mParticle?"
  - "How do I build an audience segment in mParticle?"

- **Lytics:**
  - "How do I build an audience segment in Lytics?"
  - "How can I integrate data in Lytics?"

- **Zeotap:**
  - "How can I integrate my data with Zeotap?"
  - "How do I create a user profile in Zeotap?"

## Limitations

- **Predefined Responses:** The chatbot relies on predefined responses and does not fetch real-time data from external documentation.
- **Keyword Matching:** The chatbot uses simple keyword matching to identify questions and may not understand complex or poorly phrased questions.
- **No NLP:** The chatbot does not use advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) or machine learning.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Documentation:** Fetch real-time data from the official documentation of Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap.
- **Advanced NLP:** Use NLP libraries like spaCy or TensorFlow to improve the chatbot's understanding of user questions.
- **Cross-CDP Comparisons:** Add functionality to compare features and workflows across different CDPs.

## Code Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`) that includes:
- **HTML:** The structure of the chat interface.
- **CSS:** Styling for the chat interface.
- **JavaScript:** Logic for handling user input, generating responses, and displaying messages.
